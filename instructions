      - echo Installing dependencies...
      - pip install -r requirements.txt  # Ensure you have a requirements.txt file
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building the application...
      - python -m unittest discover  # Adjust according to your build needs
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'  # Specify files to be archived
Review and Create:

Review your settings and click on Create build project.
Step 4: Set Up AWS CodePipeline
Search for CodePipeline:

Search for CodePipeline in the search bar.
Click on CodePipeline.
Create a New Pipeline:

Click on Create pipeline.
Pipeline Name: Enter a name for the pipeline (e.g., lab4-pipeline).
Configure Source Stage:

Source Provider: Choose AWS CodeCommit.
Repository: Select the repository you created (e.g., lab4-app).
Branch: Choose the branch you want to deploy (e.g., main).
Configure Build Stage:

Build Provider: Choose AWS CodeBuild.
Project Name: Select the build project you created earlier (e.g., lab4-build).
Configure Deploy Stage (Optional):

If you want to deploy your application, configure the deployment options (e.g., to an S3 bucket or ECS).
Follow the prompts to set up the deployment.
Review and Create:

Review your pipeline settings and click on Create pipeline.
Step 5: Test the Pipeline
Push Changes to CodeCommit:

Open the Cloud9 terminal and navigate to your project directory:

bash
cd ~/environment/lab4-app  # Adjust according to your project structure
Initialize a Git repository if not done already:

bash
git init
Add your files (ensure you have at least a simple Python application and requirements.txt):

bash
echo "print('Hello, World!')" > app.py  # Sample application
echo "requests" > requirements.txt  # Sample dependency
Stage and commit the changes:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Configure CodeCommit remote and push the changes:

bash
git remote add origin https://git-codecommit.<region>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/lab4-app  # Replace <region>
git push -u origin main  # Push to the main branch
Check the Pipeline Execution:

Go back to the AWS CodePipeline console.
You should see the pipeline executing the build and deploy stages.
Click on the pipeline name to view details about each stage.
Step 6: View Build Logs
Access AWS CodeBuild:
Go to the CodeBuild section.
Click on the project (e.g., lab4-build).
Click on Build history to see recent builds.
Click on a specific build to view logs and check for any errors.
